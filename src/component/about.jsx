          <p className="text-white-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            I am a passionate Full Stack Developer and I'm also on an 
            entrepreneurial journey co-founding a startup focused on 
            creating impactful tech solutions using cutting-edge technologies 
            like AI, ML, and IoT.
            This startup experience has helped me merge technical innovation with real-world problem-solving
            and product development.,Over the years, I've built and contributed to multiple projects, including SightEcho, 
            a smart wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individualscrafting seamless digital experiences
            with cutting-edge technologies.

            Beyond coding, I love exploring the world and
            unraveling the mysteries of history. When not building robust
            applications, youâ€™ll find me immersed in books, on the cricket
            field, or bringing ideas to life through code.
